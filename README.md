# SANTOS: Relationship-based Semantic Table Union Search

## Abstract

Existing techniques for unionable table search define unionability using metadata (tables must have the same or similar schemas) or column-based metrics (for example, the values in a table should be drawn from the same domain). In this work, we introduce the use of semantic relationships between pairs of columns in a table to improve the accuracy of union search. Consequently, we introduce a new notion of unionability that considers relationships between columns, together with the semantics of columns, in a principled way. To do so, we present two new methods to discover semantic relationship between pairs of columns: The first uses an existing knowledge base (KB), the second (which we call a “synthesized KB”) uses knowledge from the data lake itself. We adopt an existing Table Union Search benchmark and present new (open) benchmarks that represent small and large real data lakes. We show that our new unionability search algorithm called SANTOS outperforms a state-of-the-art union search that uses a wide variety of column-based semantics, including word embeddings and regular expressions. We show empirically in all benchmarks that our synthesized KB improves the accuracy of union search by representing relationship semantics that may not be contained in an available KB. This result hints at a promising future of creating a synthesized KBs from data lakes with limited KB coverage and using them for union search.

## Benchmark

Please visit [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18aYj1ZwXnp4OLIsmx9khqZD0oblMp8cs?usp=sharing) to download Real Data Lake Benchmark, Labeled Benchmark and relabeled TUS Benchmark. The original TUS benchmark is available at [https://github.com/RJMillerLab/table-union-search-benchmark](https://github.com/RJMillerLab/table-union-search-benchmark).

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. CD to the repo directory. Create and activate a virtual environment for this project  
  * On macOS or Linux:
      ```
      python3 -m venv env
      source env/bin/activate
      which python
      ```
  * On windows:
      ```
      python -m venv env
      .\env\Scripts\activate.bat
      where.exe python
      ```

3. Install necessary packages. We recommend using python version 3.7 or higher.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Reproducibility

1. Download benchmark tables from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18aYj1ZwXnp4OLIsmx9khqZD0oblMp8cs?usp=sharing) and upload them to their respective subfolders inside [benchmark](benchmark/) folder.

2. Download, unzip and upload [YAGO](https://yago-knowledge.org/downloads/yago-4) knowledge base to [yago/yago_original](yago/yago_original) folder.

3. Run [preprocess_yago.py](codes/preprocess_yago.py) to create entity dictionary, type dictionary, inheritance dictionary and relationship dictionary. Then run [Yago_type_counter.py](codes/Yago_type_counter.py), [Yago_subclass_extractor.py](codes/Yago_subclass_extractor.py) and [Yago_subclass_score.py](codes/Yago_subclass_score.py) one after another to generate the type penalization scores. The created dictionaries are stored in [yago/yago_pickle](yago/yago_pickle/).

4. Run [data_lake_processing_yago.py](codes/data_lake_processing_yago.py) to create yago inverted index.

5. Run [data_lake_processing_synthesized_kb.py](codes/data_lake_processing_synthesized_kb.py) to create synthesized type dictionary, relationship dictionary and synthesized inverted index.

6. Run [query_santos.py](codes/query_santos.py) to get top-k SANTOS unionable table search results.
